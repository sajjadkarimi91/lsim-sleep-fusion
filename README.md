# A New Post-Processing Method Using Latent Structure Influence Models for Channel Fusion in Automatic Sleep Staging

MATLAB codes for reproducing the paper results and figures.

The codes and data for the papers on Selected Deep Spectrum & Deep Learning Systems have been omitted, and instead, the outputs of these methods are included for easy execution.

## 1. Introduction.

This package includes the prototype MATLAB codes for Automated EEG Sleep Staging.

The implemented methods include: 

  1. Various feature extraction methods, including 
     * Multiscale permutation entropy


  2. Several dimension reduction methods including PCA, LDA and TSNE
  3. Multiple classifiers SVM, KNN, NeuralNets



## 2. Usage & Dependency.

## Dependency:
     sleep-edf dataset
     https://github.com/sajjadkarimi91/SLDR-supervised-linear-dimensionality-reduction-toolbox


## Usage:
Run "main_run.m" or "main_binary.m" to analyze the sleep staging.
